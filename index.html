            <p>Oatmeal is the best! You can dress it up as much or as little as you want, and you can add as many toppings as can fit in your bowl. It's a solid source of fiber and beneficial to those with cholesterol issues. If you need to watch your sugar intake and want to avoid oats, try quinoa porridge. Same outcome and much less of a danger to your insulin levels. Here is a recipe for quick and easy overnight oats.  </p>

                <h4>Stovetop Variation</h4>
                <p>Some people like to cook their oats, and that's ok! If you want to cook your oats on the stovetop rather than letting them soak overnight, you can use all of the same ingredients as listed above. Simply start with the wet ingredients, - add the milk to a pot and set on low heat. Add the salt, nutmeg, cinnamon, and vanilla and let simmer uncovered for 1-2 minutes. Add in the oats and stir until they are mixed well. Add the flax and chia seeds, stir for another few seconds and let boil until your desired consistency is reached. The longer you let it cook, the less liquidy your oats will be.  </p>
